Create mykey.snk for strongly named assembly

	-sn -k mykey.snk

Generate strongly named calc.dll from version 0.0.0.0 calc.cs

	-csc /keyfile:mykey.snk /t:library calc.cs

Add version 0.0.0.0 calc.dll to GACUtil global cache

	-gacutil -i calc.dll

Make driver.exe from driver.cs

	-csc /t:exe /r:calc.dll driver.cs

Generate strongly named calc.dll from version 1.0.0.0 calc_new.cs

	-csc /keyfile:mykey.snk /t:library /out:calc.dll calc_new.cs

Add version 1.0.0.0 calc.dll to GACUtil global cache

	-gacutil -i calc.dll

Now create driver.exe.config file for versioning control of dll
And run driver.exe for running driver program according to new version of calc.dll
